Vulkan4D New Project sample

Clone this repository to create a new game project using the Vulkan4D Engine

# Vulkan4D
Vulkan4D is a revolutionary game engine built from the ground up for Space Games/Simulations and with Vulkan as the sole rendering API, so that we can take full advantage of the new technology. 

### Project Structure
- `Core Modules and Helpers` Compiled into `v4d.dll` and linked into the Launcher
- `Systems` Game functionalities (and mods) compiled into individual .dll files that are loaded at runtime
- `Libraries` Other libraries used in the project
- `Resources` Icons, Textures, Music, ...
- `Launcher` App that puts it all together to run the game


**Features** will include but not limited to : 
- triple-precision physics with relative positioning system
- vulkan multithreaded renderer built from the ground up for full RTX support (ray-tracing)
- cross-platform (windows+linux) build tools
- custom SPIR-V shader compiler for GLSL with custom pragmas
- high-performance no-sql database system that takes full advantage of SSD drives
- low-latency networking system that uses both TCP and UDP simultaneously
- complex multiplayer integration tools
- orbital mechanics and newtonian physics
- dynamic sky/space background (actual stars and planets are rendered, no skybox bs)

VR may be implemented as well

**As a developer for this project or for a resulting game, you will respect our 5 Commandments : **

- Thou shall obey physics. We do not sacrifice nor compromise realism for arcade-style gameplays.  
- Thou shall not hit invisible walls. If it looks accessible, then it is. 
- Thou shall not see a skybox. Actual clouds, stars, etc.  
- Thou shall not see "Loading". Immersive, seamless transitions, no loading screens, EVER.  
- Thou shall be within thy self. Focused on fully immersive, first person view. 

** License **
V4D is going to be Open-source, with limited commercial use. 
Developers/companies that contribute to its development may get a free license for commercial use depending on the scale of their contribution (funding or development time).
